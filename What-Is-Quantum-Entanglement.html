    <h1>What Is Quantum Entanglement?</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Quantum entanglement is one of the most fascinating and mysterious phenomena in quantum physics. It occurs when two or more particles become linked in such a way that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are in space. This means that a change in one particle's properties, like spin or polarization, immediately affects the other particle, even if they are light-years apart.</p>

        <p>Albert Einstein famously called this “spooky action at a distance,” because it seemed to violate the classical idea that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light. However, experiments have repeatedly confirmed the existence of entanglement, and it has become a cornerstone of modern quantum mechanics. Entanglement does not allow faster-than-light communication, but it demonstrates a deep connection between entangled particles that defies classical intuition.</p>

        <p>Quantum entanglement has many applications in emerging technologies. For instance, it is the basis for quantum cryptography, which allows for theoretically unbreakable encryption, and quantum teleportation, where information about a particle's state is transmitted to another particle instantly. Entanglement is also crucial for quantum computing, where it helps qubits perform complex calculations far faster than classical computers.</p>

        <p>Researchers continue to study entanglement to understand its full potential. Experiments have shown that entanglement can be maintained over increasingly long distances, and scientists are exploring its use in future global quantum networks. These networks could revolutionize communication, computing, and secure data transmission, leveraging the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.</p>
