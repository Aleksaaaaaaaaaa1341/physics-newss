    <h1>How Quantum Computers Work</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Quantum computers are a revolutionary type of computing technology that use the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations far faster than classical computers for certain tasks. Unlike classical bits, which represent either 0 or 1, quantum bits or qubits can exist in superpositions, meaning they can represent 0 and 1 simultaneously.</p>

        <p>This property allows quantum computers to process massive amounts of data in parallel. Quantum entanglement is another key feature, where qubits can be interconnected in such a way that the state of one qubit directly affects the state of another, even at a distance. These features enable quantum computers to solve complex problems in cryptography, optimization, material science, and drug discovery much more efficiently than conventional computers.</p>

        <p>Quantum computers use specialized hardware, including superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and topological qubits. Quantum algorithms like Shor’s algorithm for factoring large numbers or Grover’s algorithm for database searching demonstrate the potential speedups achievable by quantum computing.</p>

        <p>Although still in the early stages of development, quantum computing promises to transform fields ranging from cybersecurity to artificial intelligence. Companies like IBM, Google, and Microsoft are actively researching and building quantum processors, making this an exciting area of cutting-edge technology.</p>
