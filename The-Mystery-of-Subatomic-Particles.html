    <h1>The Mystery of Subatomic Particles</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Subatomic particles are the tiny building blocks of matter that make up everything in the universe. At the smallest scales, atoms themselves are composed of even smaller particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons, in turn, are made of quarks, held together by the strong nuclear force, mediated by particles called gluons.</p>

        <p>Understanding subatomic particles is crucial to uncovering the fundamental nature of the universe. Particle physics studies these particles using high-energy experiments in particle accelerators, like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. Discoveries such as the Higgs boson, neutrino oscillations, and the observation of antimatter have revolutionized our understanding of physics.</p>

        <p>Subatomic particles behave according to the laws of quantum mechanics. This means they can exhibit strange properties such as superposition (existing in multiple states at once) and entanglement (instantaneously affecting each other across distances). These behaviors are counterintuitive but have been repeatedly confirmed in experiments.</p>

        <p>Studying subatomic particles also helps scientists understand the early universe, as conditions just after the Big Bang were dominated by these fundamental particles. The interactions of these particles dictate how matter formed and evolved into stars, planets, and galaxies.</p>
