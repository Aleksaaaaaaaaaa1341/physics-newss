    <h1>Bending Space-Time: Gravity's Effect</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Gravity is not simply a force pulling objects together, as Newton once described. Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity revealed that gravity is the result of massive objects bending the fabric of space-time. Imagine space-time as a stretched rubber sheet: when a massive object, like a planet or star, sits on it, the sheet curves, and other objects move along these curves, which we perceive as gravitational attraction.</p>

        <p>This curvature affects everything in the universe, including light. Light passing near a massive object bends along the curve, a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. Time itself is also affected: clocks closer to massive objects tick more slowly than those further away, a phenomenon called time dilation.</p>

        <p>Gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of space-time, are generated by massive cosmic events like merging black holes or neutron stars. Detecting these waves allows scientists to study the most extreme events in the universe and understand the fundamental nature of gravity and space-time.</p>

        <p>The bending of space-time explains many cosmic phenomena and is essential for accurate GPS technology, astrophysics research, and understanding black holes and the expansion of the universe.</p>
