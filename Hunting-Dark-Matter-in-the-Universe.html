    <h1>Hunting Dark Matter in the Universe</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Dark matter is one of the greatest mysteries in modern astrophysics. Unlike ordinary matter, it does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to traditional telescopes. Despite this, scientists know it exists because of its gravitational effects on galaxies and galaxy clusters. Without dark matter, galaxies would not rotate as they do, and the large-scale structure of the universe would look completely different.</p>

        <p>Physicists and astronomers hunt dark matter using various methods. One approach is direct detection experiments, which attempt to observe rare interactions between dark matter particles and normal matter. Another approach is indirect detection, looking for signals from the annihilation or decay of dark matter particles in space. Observations of cosmic microwave background radiation and galaxy surveys also provide crucial clues about dark matter's distribution.</p>

        <p>Particle physics theories, like supersymmetry, suggest that dark matter could be made of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) or axions. Experiments such as the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) detector and the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) onboard the International Space Station are searching for these elusive particles.</p>

        <p>Understanding dark matter is essential to fully comprehend the universe. It makes up about 27% of the universe’s total mass-energy content, far more than ordinary matter, yet its nature remains a profound puzzle.</p>
