    <h1>Why Objects Fall at the Same Rate</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p>One of the fundamental principles of physics is that, in the absence of air resistance, all objects fall at the same rate regardless of their mass. This idea was famously demonstrated by Galileo Galilei in the 16th century when he allegedly dropped two spheres of different weights from the Leaning Tower of Pisa and observed that they hit the ground at the same time.</p>

        <p>The reason objects fall at the same rate comes from the relationship between gravitational force and mass. According to Newton’s second law, force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma). The gravitational force acting on an object is proportional to its mass, so heavier objects experience a greater force. However, because they also have more mass, the acceleration produced by this force is the same as for lighter objects. Mathematically, the mass cancels out, leaving all objects to accelerate at the same rate due to gravity, approximately 9.8 m/s² on Earth.</p>

        <p>This principle has been verified in many experiments, from dropping objects in vacuum chambers to sending astronauts on the Moon, where air resistance is absent. In these environments, feathers and hammers fall at exactly the same rate, providing clear evidence for this fundamental law of physics.</p>

        <p>The idea is not only important for understanding motion but also forms the foundation of classical mechanics. It explains why engineers and scientists can predict the motion of falling objects, plan space missions, and even develop technologies like parachutes and drop testing of materials accurately.</p>

        <p>For a visual explanation, here is a YouTube video demonstrating why objects fall at the same rate:</p>
