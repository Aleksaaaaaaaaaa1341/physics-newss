    <h1>The Speed of Light Explained</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p>The speed of light is one of the most fundamental constants in physics. Denoted as <strong>c</strong>, light travels at approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (186,282 miles per second) in a vacuum. This incredible speed sets the ultimate limit for how fast information, matter, and energy can travel in our universe.</p>

        <p>Light is composed of photons, which are massless particles. Because they have no rest mass, photons can travel at the maximum possible speed allowed by the laws of physics. Even if you were in a spaceship traveling near the speed of light, you would never exceed this universal limit.</p>

        <p>The speed of light is crucial to many areas of physics. For example, Einstein’s theory of relativity is built on the fact that the speed of light is constant in all frames of reference. Time dilation, length contraction, and the relationship between energy and mass (E = mc²) all depend on this constant. It also affects how we measure distances in space and how we communicate with spacecraft millions of kilometers away.</p>

        <p>In addition, understanding light speed is essential for technologies like GPS satellites, fiber-optic communications, and astronomy. When we observe distant stars and galaxies, the light reaching us has traveled for millions or even billions of years. This means looking at the sky is essentially looking back in time.</p>

        <p>For a visual explanation, here is a YouTube video about the speed of light:</p>
