    <h1>How Nuclear Fusion Works</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Nuclear fusion is the process by which two light atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing an enormous amount of energy in the process. It is the same reaction that powers the Sun and other stars in the universe. Fusion occurs when atomic nuclei overcome their natural electrostatic repulsion and collide at extremely high temperatures and pressures.</p>

        <p>In stars, fusion typically involves hydrogen nuclei (protons) fusing to form helium. This process releases energy in the form of light and heat, which is why stars shine so brightly. Fusion reactions are incredibly efficient and can release millions of times more energy per kilogram of fuel than chemical reactions like burning coal or gas.</p>

        <p>Scientists have been trying to harness nuclear fusion for energy production on Earth because it promises a clean and virtually limitless source of power. Fusion produces no greenhouse gases and only small amounts of short-lived radioactive waste. The main challenge is creating the extreme temperatures (tens of millions of degrees Celsius) and pressures required for nuclei to overcome their repulsion and fuse.</p>

        <p>Modern fusion experiments use magnetic confinement (like in tokamaks) or inertial confinement (using powerful lasers) to achieve these conditions. If successful, fusion could revolutionize energy production, providing a safe and sustainable solution for the world’s growing energy needs.</p>
