    <h1>Understanding Einstein's Relativity</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Einstein's theory of relativity fundamentally changed the way we understand space, time, and gravity. It consists of two main parts: <strong>Special Relativity</strong> and <strong>General Relativity</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Special Relativity</strong> (1905) focuses on the physics of objects moving at high speeds, especially close to the speed of light. One of its key principles is that the laws of physics are the same for all observers, regardless of their constant velocity. Special relativity introduced concepts like time dilation, length contraction, and the famous equation <em>E=mc²</em>, showing the equivalence of mass and energy.</p>

        <p><strong>General Relativity</strong> (1915) is a theory of gravitation. It explains gravity not as a force but as a curvature of space-time caused by mass and energy. Massive objects like planets and stars bend the fabric of space-time, and this bending dictates the motion of other objects. General relativity has been confirmed through experiments such as the bending of light by the Sun, the precise orbit of Mercury, and the detection of gravitational waves.</p>

        <p>Relativity has had profound implications for our understanding of the universe, including black holes, cosmology, GPS satellite technology, and the behavior of the cosmos at large scales. It shows that time and space are not absolute but are intertwined in a dynamic, flexible fabric.</p>
